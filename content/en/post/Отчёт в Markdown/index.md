Markdown is a convenient markup language that allows you to easily and quickly create structured documents. In this post, I want to share with you some tips on designing a report using Markdown. 
 
# **Headlines**
Markdown uses the # symbol to create headings. The more # characters, the smaller the header size will be. 

## For example: 

``
# Heading 1 - will create the largest heading 
## Heading 2 is the next largest heading
``
# **Lists** 
To create bulleted lists in Markdown, asterisks (* ), hyphens (- ) or pluses (+ ) are used. 

## For example: 

* Item 1
``
* Item 1
- Item 2 
+ Point 3
``

Numbers and dots are used to create numbered lists. Example: 
 
1. Item 1 
2. Item 2

# **Text selection** 

To highlight text in bold, use double asterisks `**text**` or two underscores `__text__` . 

To make the text italicized, use single asterisks `*text*` or a single underscore `_text'. 
 
# **Inserting the code** 

To insert the code into the text, use backquote characters. For example: `code'. 
 
# **Links** 
To add links to the text, use this format: 
 
[Link text](URL)

## **Let's summarize the results**

Markdown is a great tool for creating reports, due to its simplicity and ease of use.
