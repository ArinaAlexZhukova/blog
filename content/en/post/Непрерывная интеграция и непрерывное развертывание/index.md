## What is it?

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is a software development methodology that automates the processes of building, testing, and deploying applications. The basic principle of CI/CD is to integrate the code into a common repository and test it automatically, after which the application is automatically deployed to test and product environments.

## What advantages does it have?

These practices allow you to reduce the time between writing code and putting it into production, simplify the process of updating and scaling applications, and improve the quality of the project through regular testing.

CI/CD helps developers respond faster to changes in customer requirements, respond faster to bugs, and implement new features faster. This approach also helps to reduce the risks associated with application deployment and allows you to manage the entire development cycle more efficiently.

## Let's sum up the results

The use of continuous integration and continuous deployment helps to improve the software development process, make it more transparent and predictable, and improve the quality and reliability of the applications being created. Gain a competitive advantage for developers and companies in general.
